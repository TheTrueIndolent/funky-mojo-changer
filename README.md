Funky Mojo Changer (FMoC) is an add on that enchants the way you change your specialization (a.k.a specs), your talent loadout, and your Specialization Loot!

You can open the options panel in three ways.
1. With the commands: /fmoc and /funkymojochanger
2. Through the game menu. Game Menu (Esc) --> Options --> AddOns
3. Through the minimap buttons that Blizzard gave us. Itâ€™s a tiny number at the top-left or bottom-left of the minimap, click it and you will find it.

Right now, FMoC:
- Creates one to three buttons according to your class which change your Specialization!
- Creates three to five buttons according to your class which change your Specialization Loot!
- Those buttons can change size and position!
- Creates a pop out button with the Talent Loadouts you have created which changes your Talents. You can choose the position for this button!
- You can choose an Equipment Set that you have created and assign it to a desired Talent Loadout!
- Plays a small Animation while changing Specialization or changing Talent Loadout. You can choose the dimension and the position of the Animation, and you can also make it visible or not!
- You can create a Profile so you can copy - paste your settings between your characters!
